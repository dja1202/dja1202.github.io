#My portfolio website

I have decided to work on an early draft of my portfolio as Assignment 1. This was my first experience with HTML and CSS. While I had some prior exposure to web design through Figma, I did not use it for this project. Instead, I embraced the challenge of building this site from scratch, learning the intricacies of coding as I went along.

The aim was to create a simple and functional portfolio, that includes an overview of my background, projects I have done in the past, and contact information.
